# ONRAMP-010-WEEK-TWO

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder and get it looking as close to the design as possible using HTML, CSS  and Javascript. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide` folder containing a figma file that contains information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


Make sure to check the wiki tab on git for the assessment workflow (a guide on how to setup git for version control on the project).

Do ensure to host your work using Github Pages.

Happy coding!
